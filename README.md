# Well-Being Backend

Welcome to the Well-Being Backend project! This repository contains the backend code for the Well-Being application, which provides users with tools and resources for tracking and improving their overall well-being.


## Overview
The Well-Being Backend serves as the foundation for the Well-Being app, designed to help users track and improve their mental, physical, and emotional health. It includes a set of RESTful APIs that allow users to interact with the platform, log their activities, and access personalized well-being insights. The backend also integrates Stripe to handle user subscriptions and payments for premium features.

## Technologies
- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for building the backend
- **Nest.js** – Web framework for handling requests and routing with Typescript
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for storing user data and well-being logs
- **Mongoose** – ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB
